# How to Upgrade to the Next Release

> **Prerequisites:** none. **Release:** next after 0.3.0 (0.3.1 if it contains only fixes, 0.4.0 otherwise).

This page collects the behaviour changes merged since 0.3.0. Read it before upgrading; each entry says who
is affected and what to do. See [Writing an entry](_index.md#writing-an-entry) for the format.

## Tooling changes for contributors

These affect contributors to pydomain, not users of the package.

### Code commits and PR titles need the issue prefix (DCE-106)

**What changed:** the commit-msg hook and the `Lint Commits` workflow reject `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
`refactor` and `test` commits without a `DCE-NN:` prefix. PR titles are linted the same way, because a
squash merge uses the title as the commit subject.

**Who is affected:** contributors writing commits or opening PRs.

**What to do:** start code commits and PR titles with the issue ID, e.g.
`DCE-123: fix(cqrs): drain event buffers on rollback`. Run `make pre-commit` once to install the hook.

### CI runs on Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14, and on branch pushes (DCE-107)

**What changed:** `test.yml` runs on every supported Python version and on pushes to `feature/`, `fix/`,
`chore/`, `ci/`, `docs/` and `hotfix/` branches. The Codecov upload was removed.

**Who is affected:** contributors; a red (strict-xfail) test commit now gets its own CI run.

**What to do:** nothing; link the red commit's run from the PR (ADR-066).
